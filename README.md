# Conference Room Booking Application
This project simulates a conference room booking application from a ficticious company who owns a building. The employees have accounts which can book a conference room at certain hour and day, and their bookings are saved in the system. Each user can create as many bookings as they like, but only the owner of the booking can delete the booking. This projects makes use of an external API created by me, you can find it's repositofy [here](https://github.com/MiguelDP4/meeting-booker-api).

Important note:
There's 20 default users saved in the API. To log in and test the application, simply use one of the 20 default usernames. The default usernames are called tester, plus their user id. For example:

- 'tester1'
- 'tester2'
- 'tester3'
- 'tester4'

The password for all of them is 'asdfasdf'

## Built With:
